@List Update Notifications first changelog lets go

The Tower XXII has been placed at #2, below Wendys Revenge and above ftrial. This pushes Platformer chall 1 off the top 10. Due to a lack of opinions, this placement is subject to change.

Tower of Infinity has been placed at #3, below The Tower XXII and above ftrial. This pushes The Easiest Level off the top 10. Due to a lack of opinions, this placement is subject to change.

Boring Tower has been placed at #16, below The Cake Trials and above Jet Lag. Currently there is no verification video linked but will be linked once we upload it.

Other levels in pending-list-changes will have to wait due to a lack of opinions, we would apricate it if you can give feedback to the future placement of these levels!

Wendys Revenge was the first ever top 1 added to this list. As the creator and verifier of this legendary platformer, it saddens me to see a crucial level for the list officially legacy. I knew that this day would come, but I did not expect Wendys to last this long lol. Hopefully Hoshy will continue the torch with the random wendys sequel they are making.

For the last time on the internet, this is yosh, and I am out

which was the 3rd rated Top 1 the game has seen. It is now falling off the Top 50... and another popular level The Abyss has fallen off the Top 25.... so now the brand new role @Top 25 Victor has been released for you try-hards. :smiles:

Also want to express that HYPER GRAVITRON was a Top 1 level (probably), verified at Jan. 6, while The Abyss was verified at Jan. 9, which dethrones The Abyss it's spot in the Top 1 History timeline: general
GG exsii

Along with this, comes a brand new role for those listed in the Top 1 timeline, @Former Top 1 Verifier! Brand new bragging rights role!

cl5 doesnâ€™t even make any sense, nobody uses 5 for the letter "A", you use 4, and for the S youâ€™d use 5 but instead they used 3???? 3 is used for the letter e this is actually so dumb how have i never noticed this until now
it should be Cl4u57r0ph0b1a if youâ€™re not stupid
