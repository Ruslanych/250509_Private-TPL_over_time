- **TowerDespair** has been moved from #47 to #54, above **Infinity Trial** and below **Robot King**. (Maybe subject to move??)

This pushes Fettuccini Chamber, IWannaBeTheHades, tetris grandmaster, DASH KING, Tower of Infinity, chce byc chlopem, Ravioli Chamber, Infinity Trial, TowerDespair, Robot King, Dance With Me, monochromatic, but most importantly **Wendys Revenge** off the list.

Wendys Revenge was the first ever top 1 added to this list. As the creator and verifier of this legendary platformer, it saddens me to see a crucial level for the list officially legacy. I knew that this day would come, but I did not expect Wendys to last this long lol. Hopefully Hoshy will continue the torch with the random wendys sequel they are making.

For the last time on the internet, this is yosh, and I am out

R.I.P. Wendys Revenge
